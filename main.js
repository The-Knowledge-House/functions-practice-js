//Exercise #1
//Write a function that loops over the following array of TKH students
// and prints out their name and what class they are currently in.
const students = [
	"Angel",
	"Ayman",
	"David",
	"Diana",
	"Ezra",
	"Jahaziel",
	"Jennifer",
	"Julian",
	"Katherine",
	"Leesel",
	"Naeem",
	"Nashid",
	"Quiana",
	"Shafee",
	"Shan",
	"Stephanie",
	"Tinesha",
	"Zipporah",

	for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
		console.log(`${arr1[i]} is in the ${arr2[1]} class.`);
	}
}
tkhStudents(students, course);

//Exercise #2
//Write a function named calculateDogAge that:
//takes one argument: your puppy's age
//calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of
// 1 human year to 7 dog years
//outputs the result to the screen like so:
//"Your dog is something years old in dog years"
//call the function with different sets of values
//Add an additional argument to the function that takes the conversion
//rate of human to dog years
function calculateDogAge(age) {
	let dogAge = 7 * age;

	console.log(`Your dog is ${dogAge} years old in dog years`);
}

calculateDogAge(1);

//Exercise #3
//Write a function named calculateSupply that:
// takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day
// calculates the amount consumed for the rest of the life(based on a benchmark age)
//  outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need SOMETHING to last you until the age of X"
// Call that function several times, using different values each time
// Bonus: accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the
// result to a round number
function calculateSupply(age, amountPerDay) {
	let ageMax = 80;
	let totalNeeded = amountPerDay * 365 * (ageMax - age);
	let lifeMessage = `You will need ${totalNeeded} cups of water to last you until the age of ${ageMax}`;

	console.log(lifeMessage);
}

calculateSupply(20, 80);

//Exercise #4
//http://math2.org/math/geometry/circles.htm
//
//Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle:
//First: Create a function called calcCircumference
// - Pass the radius to the function
// - Calculate the circumference based on the radius
// - and output " The circumference is SOMETHING"
// Second: Create a function called calcArea:
// - Pass the radius to the function
// - Calculate the area based on the radius and output "The area is SOMETHING"
function calcCircumferenceArea(radius) {
	let circumference = Math.PI * 2 * radius;
	console.log(`The circimference is ${circumference}`);

	let area = Math.PI * (radius * radius);
	console.log(`The area is ${area}`);
}

calcCircumferenceArea(10);

//Exercise #5
//Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:
// - store a celsius temperature into a variable
// - convert it to fahrenheit and output "SOMETHING degrees Celsius is Something degrees Fahrenheit"
//Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:
// - Now store a fahrenheit temperature int a variable
// - Convert it to celsius and output "SOMETHING degrees Fahrenheit is SOMETHING degrees Celsius"

function celsiusToFahrenheit(celsius) {
	let celsiusInF = (celsius * 9) / 5 + 32;
	console.log(`${celsius}째C is ${celsiusInF}째F`);

	let fahrenheitInC = ((fahrenheit - 32) * 5) / 9;
	console.log(`${fahrenheit}째F is ${fahrenheitInC}째C`);
}

fahrenheitToCelsius();

//Exercise #6
//Write a function that takes 3 parameters and returns one number, which is
//the product of the first two numbers raised to the power of the third
//passing this function 1,2,3 should give you back the answer to (1 * 2)^3
function powerOfThree(num1, num2, power) {
	let multiplyNum = (num1 * num2) ** power;
	return multiplyNum;
